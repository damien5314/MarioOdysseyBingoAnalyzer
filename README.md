This is a Firefox extension that analyzes Bingo boards for Super Mario Odyssey generated by [BingoSync](https://bingosync.com/), in order to find the earliest possible finishes for each row, column, and diagonal. The original logic was written by AzHarcos. This extension makes it easier to generate the output for a board by automatically pulling the `<body>` tag from the page and displaying the results underneath the Bingo board.

Credit to AzHarcos for the original analysis script packaged as an HTML page 👏
